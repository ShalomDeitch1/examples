#concept and requirements for ticketmaster/tech-notifications
 - The concept of the project ticketmast/tech-notifications is to give simple examples of how send notifications from the server to the client.
 - Each implementation should be as simple as possible in it's own sub-project.
 - Each sub-project MUST have a README.md file that describes how to implement the method exampled in that subproject and includes mermaid graph(s) and sequence diagram(s) as needed to make everything clear.
 - The implementation will be in java 21 and springboot 3.5.9.
 - If there is any complex logic there will be a unit test and a comment in the file that explains how it works. 
 - At this stage any existing README.md file or plan.md file can be updated.
 - Ensure that there is a way to run each method and clear instructions in the README.md file. There should be good visablilty in the test to be able to see that the method works and any important details shoule be apparent

 - The README.md file in the tech-notifications folder should give an overview of the 3 methods and link to each sub-project.

KEEP EVERYTHING AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE

The output should be:
 1. updated README.md files in tech-notifications folder and all the sub-projects
 2. updated plan.md that details what should be done to implement each level
