# design
This project is to present System Design principals using examples from the hellointerview site.
The idea is to present tools used to make relaiable, low latency, scaleable systems.
The availabilty vs consistency should be as needed for the project.

### Rules:
 - always use the most simple design possible
 - the examples here are all Java with Springboot. Use localstack and TestContainers when needed.
 - each project is made up of subprojects, where the subproject either shows how to use some technology
   or uses technologies to implement the subject of the design
 - each subproject has a README.md file that describes used in that subproject.
 - if a subproject has subprojects then the README.md file should link to those subprojects and give a short description what each one does 
 - the README.md files that are not in subprojects that contains other subprojects should had mermaid graphs of the flow and sequence of the code presented in that subproject and a description why and when to use it. If there are times not to use it, those should be presented too. If there are alternatives, mention that also.

 - ask questions to get a better design and clarify requirements
